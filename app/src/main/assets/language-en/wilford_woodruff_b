Born March 1, 1807, at Avon (Farmington), Hartford Co., Connecticut, to Aphek Woodruff and Beulah Thompson.
A miller by trade, he joined the Church in 1833 and served two missions before being ordained an apostle on April 26, 1839, by Brigham Young, at age 32. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he completed four additional missions, presided over the temple in St. George, Utah, and served six years as Church historian. He was sustained as Church president on April 7, 1889, at age 82.
As president of the Church, he dedicated temples in Salt Lake City and Manti, Utah, oversaw the organization of the Genealogical Society, and re-emphasized the value of historical record-keeping. After much pondering and prayer, he received a revelation that the Latter-day Saints should cease the practice of plural marriage.
In 1890, he wrote the Manifesto, testifying that the Church had ceased teaching the practice of plural marriage. In addition to being the Lord's mouthpiece for that revelation, President Woodruff also left a legacy that emphasized missionary and temple work. He died in San Francisco, California, on Sept. 2, 1898, at age 91.
