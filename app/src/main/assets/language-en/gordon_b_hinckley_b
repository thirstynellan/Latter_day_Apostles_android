Born June 23, 1910, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Bryant S. and Ada Bitner Hinckley. As a young man, he earned a reputation as an outstanding writer and speaker because of his ability with words. After graduating from the University of Utah in 1932 with a major in English, he served a mission in the British Isles from 1933-1935. Upon his return home, he reported to the First Presidency in an interview that led to employment with the Church as secretary of the then-recently formed Radio, Publicity, and Mission Literature Committee. Except for a short period during World War II, he worked for the Church for nearly 25 years, where he pioneered the adaptation of Church materials, particularly historical, for radio and later television programming and prepared various materials for missionaries. In 1951, he was called as executive secretary of the General Missionary Committee.
On April 29, 1937, he married Marjorie Pay in the Salt Lake Temple. They had five children. She died April 6, 2004. Prior to being called as a General Authority, he was a third-generation stake president and served on the Sunday School General Board.
He was sustained as an Assistant to the Twelve April 6, 1958. Three-and-a-half years later, on Sept. 30, 1961, he was sustained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and was ordained an apostle on Oct. 5, 1961, at age 51. He served in the Twelve for 20 years and then served 14 years as a counselor to three Church presidents: Presidents Spencer W. Kimball, from 1981-1985; Ezra Taft Benson, from 1985-1994; and Howard W. Hunter, from 1994-1995. He was ordained and set apart as the 15th president of the Church on March 12, 1995, at age 84.
As president of the Church, President Hinckley had a strong desire to be out among the people and during his presidency he traveled more than a million miles and spoke to hundreds of thousands of members in more than 60 nations in Africa, Asia, the Pacific-, Europe, and North, Central and South America. He was the first Church president to visit mainland China, West Africa, Russia and Ukraine.
A man of wit and wisdom, President Hinckley left behind a rich legacy. He envisioned the concept of small temples - perhaps the hallmark of his presidency - which helped fulfill his desire to provide temples close to members wherever they were. During the 12 years of his presidency, 79 new temples were announced worldwide. He dedicated 63 of the 77 temples that were dedicated during the same period. During the time he served in the First Presidency, he dedicated or rededicated 95 of the 124 temples then in operation. His leadership advanced the Church on every front, and construction of the massive Conference Center in Salt Lake City will forever be linked with his legacy.
He was awarded 10 honorary degrees, and in 2004, was given the United States' highest civil award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President George Bush.
He died Jan. 27, 2008, at age 97, after a long life of dedicated service to God and his fellowman. He had the distinction of being the longest-lived president of the Church.
