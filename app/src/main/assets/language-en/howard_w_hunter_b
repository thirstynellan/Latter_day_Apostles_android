Born Nov. 14, 1907, Boise, Ada Co., Idaho, to John William Hunter and Nellie Marie Rasmussen.
He had a love for music in his youth. After high school, his band, `Hunter's Croonaders,' toured for five months on the SS President Jackson, which gave him the opportunity to see many exotic sites in Asia. 
He married Clara May (Claire) Jeffs June 10, 1931, she died Oct. 9, 1983; they had three children (one died in infancy). He married Inis Bernice Egan on April 12, 1990.
Upon his marriage to Clara May Jeffs in 1931, he gave up his music career in favor of a stable family life. He studied law and became a successful lawyer in California. Various positions of priesthood leadership prepared him for his call to the apostleship in 1959. He was ordained an apostle Oct. 15, 1959, by David 0. McKay, and set apart as acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Nov. 10, 1985, and as president of the Quorum of the Twelve on June 4, 1988.
After 35 years as an apostle, he became president of the Church on June 5, 1994, at age 86. During his short presidency, he challenged all members of the Church to become temple worthy, prior to a decade of increased temple building, and invited members who had become offended to come back to the Church. He traveled as often as his health permitted, dedicating two temples and commemorating the 150th anniversary of the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith in Nauvoo and Carthage, M.
He died March 3, 1995, in Salt Lake City, Utah, at age 87.
