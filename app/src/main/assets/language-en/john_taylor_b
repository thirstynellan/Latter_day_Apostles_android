Born November 1, 1808, in Milnthorpe, Westmorland, England, to James Taylor and Agnes Taylor.
An 1832 immigrant to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, he was a cooper and part-time Methodist minister.
He and his wife, Leonora, joined the Church in 1836.
Two years later, on Dec. 19, 1838, he became an apostle under the hands of Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball, at age 30.
He was sustained as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Oct. 6, 1877.
He enjoyed close association with Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.
He accompanied Joseph Smith to Carthage, Illinois, in June 1844, and was seriously wounded when Joseph Smith was killed.
He was sustained as president of the Church on October 10, 1880, during one of the most challenging periods in Church history.
The Church was persecuted for the practice of plural marriage and many Latter-day Saints were being fined, imprisoned and denied the vote due to their beliefs and practices.
He organized members to meet this trial of their faith and for the last 2 1/2 years of his life administered the affairs of the Church from seclusion resulting from anti-polygamy legislation.
After seven eventful years as president, he died July 25, 1887, in Kaysville, Utah, at age 78.
