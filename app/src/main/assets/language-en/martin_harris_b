Martin Harris (May 18, 1783  – July 10, 1875) was an early convert to the Latter Day Saint movement who guaranteed the first printing of the Book of Mormon and also served as one of Three Witnesses who testified that they had seen the golden plates from which Joseph Smith said the Book of Mormon had been translated.
The Smith family moved to Palmyra in 1816, and in 1824, Harris employed Joseph Smith, Sr. to dig a well and a cistern.
