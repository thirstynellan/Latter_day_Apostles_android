Born Aug. 4, 1899, in Whitney, Franklin Co., Idaho, to George T. Benson and Sarah Dunldey, he learned early the principle of hard work on the family farm. He served a mission to Great Britain and after his return was married to his sweetheart, Flora Amussen, on Sept. 10, 1926; they had six children. He received his education in agriculture and went on to hold many important positions within the industry.
He was ordained an apostle on Oct. 7, 1943, by President Heber J. Grant, at age 44, after having been president of two stakes. From 1953 to 1961, he served as Secretary of Agriculture in the cabinet of U. S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was set apart as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Dec. 30, 1973.
On Nov. 10, 1985, he became president of the Church, at age 86. Having a resolute testimony of the power of the Book of Mormon, he emphasized the importance of it in daily scripture study, missionary efforts, and gospel teaching. His love of freedom, home, and family were also evident in his addresses and counsel to Church members. Despite his failing health, the Church continued to grow under his administration, temples were dedicated, and missionary work expanded around the world, particularly in eastern Europe.
He died in Salt Lake City, Utah, on May 30, 1994, at age 94.
