Born April 4, 1870, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to John Henry Smith and Sarah Farr. Married Lucy Emily Woodruff May 25, 1892 (she died Nov. 5, 1937); they had three children.
His father and grandfather, George A. Smith, were counselors to Church presidents. While employed in the Federal Land Office for Utah, he was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on Oct. 8, 1903, at age 33, by Joseph F. Smith. He was sustained as president of the Quorum of the Twelve July 1, 1943.
Despite fragile health and impaired eyesight, he had a distinguished career as a Church leader. He became president of the Church on May 21, 1945, at age 75.
He organized the Church's massive welfare assistance to Europe following World War II. He also championed Scouting among Latter-day Saints. Through numerous other civic and Church responsibilities, President Smith lived that portion of his personal creed that declared, "I would be a friend to the friendless and find joy in ministering to the needs of the poor" (Improvement Era Mat 1932, 295).
After six years as president, he died in Salt Lake City on his 81st birthday, April 4, 1951.
